# Translation of American Sign Language Gestures
This project utilizes CNNs, RFCs, and SVCs to recognise hand gestures and translate sign language videos into text.
 路	Machine Learning - Course Project
 路	Tuned support vector, random forest and gradient boosting classifiers to build an ensemble learning model based on hard voting
 路	Extracted Histogram of Gradients, Local Binary Patterns, and DAISY features from the images
 路	Utilized techniques like hard negative mining and non-maximal suppression for localization of the hand performing the gesture
